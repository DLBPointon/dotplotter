# Coursework-1836811

## 29/11/19
- Started and outlined use of Argument Parser command structure.
- Started outline of definitions I may need for the script.
- Pycodestyle compliant and pylint score of 3.75 (due to the early nature of the script)
- Arg.Parse structure is reused from personal work found on GitHub-

## 3/12/19
- Added more structure to the script.
- Added more functions.
- Added import statements.
- pycodestyle compliant and pylint score of 5.93.
- Updated from sys.argv to arg.parse options.

## 4/12/19
- Half of the functions now work.
- Structure has been lost and work has become rather 'scatty'.
- There is some duplication of efforts where I have gotten carried away.

## 4/12/19
- Over complecated structure of dotplot.py has lead me to start again in basics.py.
- basics.py takes input sequences and returns the inner space of a dotplot.`
